        <h1>About Mitti Mithra</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Mitti Mithra</strong> is a community-driven initiative focused on promoting sustainable agricultural practices, soil health, and environmental awareness.

        <p>
          Our mission is to reconnect people with the earth by encouraging organic farming, composting, and eco-conscious living. 
          We believe in nurturing not just the soil, but the bond between nature and society.

          Through educational workshops, digital tools, and grassroots campaigns, Mitti Mithra empowers farmers, students, and urban communities to become guardians of the environment.
